# This file can be used to configure the Node.js build for Antora ci without
# having Node installed locally. See 'transition-docs/antora_setup.adoc' in the root
# of this repo for details of how to use this file.
#
# The action add-and-commit will always commit the package-lock.json,
# package.json and Antora cache only if changes are made to the files.
#
# If the package-lock.json or package.json files are updated or new depends are
# installed, the 'npm ci' should be always ran thereafter to speed up build
# times. When ci is active, the package-lock.json and package.json files in root
# will not be updated.
#
# Uses the action actions-gh-page to publish pages to the gh-pages branch,
# including a required .nojekyll file that Antora requires for configuration.
#
# The 'actions/cache@v2' creates a new cache when the packages in
# package-lock.json file change, or when the workflow runner's operating system
# changes.
