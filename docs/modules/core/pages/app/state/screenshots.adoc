= Taking Screenshots
:revnumber: 2.0
:revdate: 2020/07/25


The com.jme3.app.state.ScreenshotAppState enables your users to take screenshots of the running game.

You activate this feature as follows in your simpleInitApp() method:

[source,java]
----

ScreenshotAppState screenShotState = new ScreenshotAppState();
this.stateManager.attach(screenShotState);

----

The default screenshot key is KeyInput.KEY_SYSRQ, also known as "`System Request / Print Screen`" key. On Mac keyboards, this key does not exist, so on Mac +++<abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>+++ you take screenshots using Command+Shift+3 (fullscreen) or Command+Shift+4 (windowed: press space to select a window and then click).

The screenshot is saved to the user directory.
