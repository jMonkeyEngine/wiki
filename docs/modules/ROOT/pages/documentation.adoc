== Forum

The link:http://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/[forum] is your first stop when reporting bugs, making contributions, discussing wiki content, or anything else that you can't get the answer for by reading the wiki or searching the forum archives. You will find it to be a friendly and inviting place to have discussions, but before posting, there are two minor rules you will need to observe.

.  For questions that include code, learn link:https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/t/how-to-type-code-blocks/31155[how to use code blocks]. If you fail to do so, you will at best be reminded of your lapse in judgment and may not receive an answer to your question at all otherwise. See the <<github_tips#,Github Tips>> page for info on how to insert links into your posts.

pass:[*] The SDK creates Ant-based projects that any Java IDE can import. We recommend users of other IDEs to also download the jMonkeyEngine SDK and choose `menu:File[Import Project > External Project Assets]` to create a codeless project for managing assets only. This way you can code in the IDE of your choice, and use the SDK to convert your models to .j3o format.


== Create
