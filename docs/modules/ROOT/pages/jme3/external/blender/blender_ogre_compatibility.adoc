== Tips

Tips for exporting animations through OgreXML correctly:

*  apply all transformations
*  armature should have 0,0,0 transformation (loc,rot,scale)
*  model object should have 0,0,0 transformation (loc,rot,scale)
*  root bone should have 0,0,0 transformation (loc,rot,scale)
*  no envelopes
