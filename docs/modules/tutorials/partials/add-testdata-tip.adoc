[TIP]
====
To use the example assets in a new jMonkeyEngine SDK project:

ANT: Right-click your project, select menu:Properties[Libraries > Add Library], and add the "`jme3-test-data`" library.

GRADLE: In *build.gradle* change `jmeVer` from 3.3.0-stable to 3.4.0-stable(or whatever the current latest version is), replace `jCenter()` with `mavenCentral()`. Then, in the dependency section you need to add `implementation "org.jmonkeyengine:jme3-testdata:$\{jmeVer\}"`. If you want to support opening model files in other formats(xml, etc), add `implementation "org.jmonkeyengine:jme3-plugins:$\{jmeVer\}"`. Once that is done, in the projects tab right click on the *Configurations*, select *Download Sources*, and after it's done, *Download Java docs*.
