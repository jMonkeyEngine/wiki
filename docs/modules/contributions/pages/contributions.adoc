The following list contains additional content for jMonkeyEngine 3 contributed by users. They are, as is the engine itself, open-source - Feel free to download and use them for your projects. :)


[TIP]
====
To install a jMonkeyEngine SDK plugin, go to `menu:Tools[Plugins>Available Plugins]`. +
(Currently only jME 3.0 stable SDK, jME 3.1+ does not yet support plugins)
====


== Libraries with Maven coordinates

JMonkeyEngine projects built using https://gradle.org/[Gradle]
or https://maven.apache.org/[Maven]
can easily incorporate pre-built libraries from public Maven repositories.

"GroupID:ArtifactID" entries link to package information;
follow these links to determine the version ID of the latest release.
"Name" entries link to relevant documentation, if any.
