create a demo video to show off your hard work. Or maybe you want to
make a cutscene for your game using the physics and characters in the
game itself.  Screen capturing is the most straightforward way to do
this, but it can slow down your game and produce low-quality video and
audio as a result. A better way is to record video and audio directly
from the game while it is running using VideoRecorderAppState.</p></div>

no further than jMonkeyEngine 3&#8217;s built in <code>VideoRecorderAppState</code>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The game will run slow, but the recording will be in high-quality and
normal speed. Recording starts when the state is

<div class="paragraph"><p>The video files will be stored in your <strong>user home directory</strong>.

<div class="paragraph"><p>Download the archive in your preferred format, extract,
add the jars to your project, and you are ready to go.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The javadoc is here:
<a href="http://www.aurellem.com/jmeCapture/docs/">http://www.aurellem.com/jmeCapture/docs/</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To capture video and audio you use the
<code>com.aurellem.capture.Capture</code> class, which has two methods,
<code>captureAudio()</code> and <code>captureVideo()</code>, and the
<code>com.aurellem.capture.IsoTimer</code> class, which sets the audio and
video framerate.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The steps are:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock"><div class="content"><pre class="CodeRay highlight"><code data-lang="java">yourApp.setTimer(<span class="keyword">new</span> IsoTimer(desiredFramesPerSecond));</code></pre></div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This causes jMonkeyEngine to take as much time as it needs to fully
calculate every frame of the video and audio.  You will see your game
speed up and slow down depending on how computationally demanding your
game is, but the final recorded audio and video will be perfectly
sychronized and will run at exactly the fps which you specified.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock"><div class="content"><pre class="CodeRay highlight"><code data-lang="java">captureVideo(yourApp, targetVideoFile);
captureAudio(yourApp, targetAudioFile);</code></pre></div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>These will cause the app to record audio and video when it is run.
Audio and video will stop being recorded when the app stops. Your
audio will be recorded as a 44,100 Hz linear PCM wav file, while the
video will be recorded according to the following rules:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>1.) (Preferred) If you supply an empty directory as the file, then
the video will be saved as a sequence of .png files, one file per
frame.  The files start at 0000000.png and increment from there.
You can then combine the frames into your preferred
container/codec. If the directory is not empty, then writing
video frames to it will fail, and nothing will be written.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>2.) If the filename ends in “.avi then the frames will be encoded as
a RAW stream inside an AVI 1.0 container.  The resulting file
will be quite large and you will probably want to re-encode it to
your preferred container/codec format.  Be advised that some
video payers cannot process AVI with a RAW stream, and that AVI
1.0 files generated by this method that exceed 2.0GB are invalid
according to the AVI 1.0 <abbr title="specification">spec</abbr> (but many programs can still deal
with them.)  Thanks to
<a href="http://www.randelshofer.ch/blog/2008/08/writing-avi-videos-in-pure-java/">Werner Randelshofer</a>
for his excellent work which made the AVI file writer option possible.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>3.) Any non-directory file ending in anything other than “.avi will
be processed through Xuggle.  Xuggle provides the option to use
many codecs/containers, but you will have to install it on your
system yourself in order to use this option. Please visit
<a href="http://www.xuggle.com/">http://www.xuggle.com/</a> to learn how to do this.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that you will not hear any sound if you choose to record sound to
a file.</p></div>

<div class="sect2"><h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>A standard JME3 application that extends <code>SimpleApplication</code> or
<code>Application</code> tries as hard as it can to keep in sync with
<em>user-time</em>.  If a ball is rolling at 1 game-mile per game-hour in the
game, and you wait for one user-hour as measured by the clock on your
wall, then the ball should have traveled exactly one game-mile. In
order to keep sync with the real world, the game throttles its physics
engine and graphics display.  If the computations involved in running
the game are too intense, then the game will first skip frames, then
sacrifice physics accuracy.  If there are particuraly demanding
computations, then you may only get 1 fps, and the ball may tunnel
through the floor or obstacles due to inaccurate physics simulation,
but after the end of one user-hour, that ball will have traveled one
game-mile.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When we&#8217;re recording video, we don&#8217;t care if the game-time syncs with
user-time, but instead whether the time in the recorded video
(video-time) syncs with user-time. To continue the analogy, if we
recorded the ball rolling at 1 game-mile per game-hour and watched the
video later, we would want to see 30 fps video of the ball rolling at
1 video-mile per <em>user-hour</em>. It doesn&#8217;t matter how much user-time it
took to simulate that hour of game-time to make the high-quality
recording.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The IsoTimer ignores real-time and always reports that the same amount
of time has passed every time it is called. That way, one can put code
to write each video/audio frame to a file without worrying about that
code itself slowing down the game to the point where the recording
would be useless.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect2"><h3 id="advanced-example">Advanced Example</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>The package from aurellem.com was made for AI research and can do more
than just record a single stream of audio and video. You can use it
to:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>1.) Create multiple independent listeners that each hear the world
from their own perspective.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>2.) Process the sound data in any way you wish.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>3.) Do the same for visual data.</p></div>

other examples in the jmeCapture.jar file included in the
distribution.</p></div>
