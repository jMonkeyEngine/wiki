<div class="paragraph"><p>It’s a “rather new” programming paradigm. Despite of its name and even the fact it’s was born from the marriage of “Component base architecture” and “Data oriented architecture”, but something different.</p></div></div></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>but note that Entity System really stand on its own terminology on this single page:
We are talking about the ES within COP, but implemented by an pure OOP like Java.</p></div></div></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In computer programming, data-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the program statements describe the data to be matched and the processing required rather than defining a sequence of steps to be taken</p></div>

<div class="sect1"><h2 id="data-driven-solution-architecture">Data driven solution (architecture):</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="literalblock"><div class="content"><pre>  Data driven, on the other hand, can mean a few different things. A common usage is one you may already be using. For example. abstracting something like:
  if( a == 0 ) doFoo()
  else if( a == 1 ) doBar()
  into:
  Command[] commands….
  commands[a].doIt()
  …is a data-driven design.</pre></div></div>
<div class="literalblock"><div class="content"><pre>  Data driven solution (architecture) is a software solution (architecture) where everything is from data and to data, data who decide!</pre></div></div>
<div class="literalblock"><div class="content"><pre>  http://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/business-intelligence/3-rules-for-data-driven-architecture.html</pre></div></div>
<div class="literalblock"><div class="content"><pre>  It has the “data force”, that’s why it call ‘driven’, the force sometime a “generative force”!</pre></div></div></div></div>
<div class="sect2"><h3 id="data-oriented-design-architecture">Data oriented (design) architecture:</h3><div class="literalblock"><div class="content"><pre>  Data oriented design is an approach that extracts the operations on the data from the “objects” and flattens the things that they need to run in order to be cache friendly. According to the literature (I got my first exposure in Game Engine Gems 2, Chapter 15), in many cases it actually simplifies the code.</pre></div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>From atomix ‘s overview:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Data oriented architecture is focus in Data arrangement and process(delay of data and the dataflow) and everything is Data, with a repository! It have more aspects than Data driven architecture and not talking about “the force of generative data”.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In hardware level, data oriented appear in structure and operations of chip set, when input and output are carefullly design to get batch/cache efficient.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In software level, programming language such as Java:
Data oriented architecture appear as we save everything in a big repository (database… or file repository) then retrive it to do operations. Important note, the consideration that everything is Data is very important. We can load everything as data, code, configs, signal from network, service… Second the existence of the repository is also important, as it the premise of other concept about ports, dataflow, stream, event, process, monitoring etc…</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Compare to service oriented, it care more about the delay of data and the dataflow, not the operation.
Compare to object oriented, it just only have the data concept, not object, instance or what ever…</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Data oriented architecture usually envolve every generic way to descible data, common via XML. They also usually use a data oriented architecture as the base of other.
As seen in hardware level, the signal in send in CPU as the repository, via ports, in a stream, trigger interrupt as Event,…
The same in a software level system, in Java world such as Oracle’s Buisiness Process Management (BPM). They essentially use XML to describle everything and consider everything is Data, also have concept of Ports, Stream, Event, Process…</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So normally Data oriented architecture go along with Data driven… but they are two different thing!</p></div>
<div class="sect2"><h3 id="why-so-much-people-in-java-world-get-this-wrong-at-first">Why so much people in java world get this wrong at first?</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>But of course Oracle solution are much more complex than a single chipset, as it also envolve EJB, SOAP… with also an candidate for “Data driven architecture”… That’s . But EJB and SOAP are essential pieces of BPM “Data oriented architecture”!!!</p></div></div></div></div><div id="footer"><div id="footer-text">Version <br>Last updated 2017-11-14 05:28:25 +00:00</div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/docsearch.js/2/docsearch.min.js"></script><script>docsearch({
