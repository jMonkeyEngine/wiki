= Converting the Wiki to Antora
:author: mitm
:revnumber: 1.0
:revdate: 5/9/2020
:experimental:

== Getting Started

Setup is based off link:https://help.github.com/en/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-nodejs-with-github-actions[Using Node.js with GitHub Actions], link:https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows[Caching dependencies to speed up workflows], and the link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/install/install-antora/[Install Antora] guides. It is expected that the repository has already been cloned locally.

.Definitions
. GitHub Web Interface (GWI)
. Git Command Line Interface (CLI)
. Continuous Integration (CI)

.Tools needed
. A gitHub account.
. The Atom Editor, setup for using AsciiDoctor.
. Git (CLI).

== Activating Dispatch Event

We use a dispatch_event to build the wiki anytime there are new changes tagged on the wiki-ui repository.

To activate the `Docs Dispatch Event` command, it must share a personal access token, with permissions `public_repo`, with the jMonkeyEngine Wiki.

You setup the token first from your personal account with the token name `WIKI_UI_DISPATCH`.

See: https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line

Then in the wiki-ui repository under menu:Settings[Secrets] add the new token with the format:

```
username:token
```

== Setup of Node.js

GitHub Actions requires a workflow file (main.yml) to be located in a `.github/workflows` folder. In order to use (CI) with the workflow, there must be a `package.json` and `package-lock.json` file located in the root of the repository. Node.js will build and update these files for us.

* We use an action named "`EndBug/add-and-commit@v4`" to commit the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files to the repository any time there are changes that affect these files.
* We use an action named "`peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3`" to publish the built website to the `gh-pages` branch whenever there is a push to the repo.
* We use a `repository_dispatch` webhook event configured to recieve events from the wiki-ui repo to build the docs whenever there is a new release pushed to the UI repository.

These steps are all built into the workflow file.

[NOTE]
====
You can edit/add the main.yml from a git (CLI) or the (GWI) only.

This tutorial uses (CLI) for workflow file edits, and the Atom Editor for editing all other files. Since both the (CLI) and Atom Editor are working with the same repository, both will stay synchronized with the local repository.
====

== Prepare Repository

. From the (CLI):
.. Checkout a new branch named `antora-setup`.
.. Create the destination folder `docs/modules/ROOT` in the root of the local repository.
.. Move the folders found inside the Wiki `src/docs/` folder to the destination folder.
+
--
This will be the destination final results.
```
|-docs
   |-modules
      |-ROOT
         |-images
         |-pages
         |-resources
```

[IMPORTANT]
====

Use `git mv` from the (CLI) to retain all history.

git mv [-v] [-n] <source> <destination>

pass:[*] [-n] option will do nothing; only show what would happen. Remove when ready to complete the move.

====

[cols="2",header=true]
|===
a|<source>
a|<destination>

a|`src/docs/images`
a|`docs/modules/ROOT/images`

a|`src/docs/resources`
a|`docs/modules/ROOT/resources`

a|`src/docs/asciidocs`
a|`docs/modules/ROOT/pages`

|===

IMPORTANT: The move to the `docs/modules/ROOT/pages` folder is a rename of the `asciidoc` folder. Do not move the folder into pages.

--
.. Add, commit and push the `antora-setup` branch to the repository.

== Setup Workflow

All files for setup can be found inside the `transition-docs` module where this document is located.  These are the final configuration files using the `master` branch to trigger builds and assume all steps have been completed and Antora is now in control of the build process for the wiki.

Using the workflow shown below will execute on the `antora-setup` branch pushing the build to the `gh-pages` branch allowing setup to be completed. This will allow for testing the build prior to merging the branch to `master`.

The changes that affect the workflow branch are as follows:
```
on:
  push:
    branches: [ antora-setup ]

    uses: actions/checkout@v2
    with:
      ref: antora-setup
```

TIP: It's a good idea to have the (GWI) actions tab open in a browser so the build can be monitored.

The action `EndBug/add-and-commit@v4` will commit to the branch that triggered the workflow.

. From the (CLI):
.. Create a `.github/workflows` folder in the `antora-setup` branch.
.. Add the initial "`main.yml`" file below as a new workflow.
+
--

NOTE: The initial file is designed to be used in steps, commenting and uncommenting commands as the changeover progresses. The finalized link:{attachmentsdir}/main.yml[main.yml] is in the `transition-docs` module.

The initial main points of interest are as follows.

```
repository_dispatch:
  types: [wiki-ui-build]
```
When the webhook event `repository_dispatch` is triggered, with a secret `WIKI_UI_DISPATCH` token that matches the same secret token of this repository and with the `event_type` "`wiki-ui-build`", the workflow build will run.

See:

* https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create-a-repository-dispatch-event
* https://blog.marcnuri.com/triggering-github-actions-across-different-repositories/
* https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#external-events-repository_dispatch

```
#Static version is used to maintain stability.
runs-on: ubuntu-18.04

strategy:
  matrix:
    #Static version is used to maintain stability.
    node-version: [12.17.0]
```

With the above lines, we are using a static version of `Unbuntu` and `Node.js`. Updates can potentially break things, and we would find out after the fact rather than knowing immediately that there was a problem.

[TIP]
====
Setting the node version using the matrix strategy has the added benefit of appending the Node.js version to our job `build` on the (GWI) dashboard.

For example, our job name `build`, will have the version `12.17.0` appended like so:

image::vers_append.png[vers_append.png]
====

```
- name: Install default package.json
  run: npm init --yes
```
The above line will create our default `package.json` file that will control the (CI) and hold any command line scripts we implement. Once this file is commited to the repo, this line is no longer used.

```
- name: Install Node
  run: npm i
```
This will install node into our workflow and create our initial `package-lock.json` file. Once the `package-lock.json` file is committed, this line will only be used to when adding new packages by appending the package name to the command. Change it to `run: npm update` to update depends.

```
- name: Install Antora
  run: |
   npm i @antora/cli@2.3
   npm i @antora/site-generator-default@2.3
   npm i asciidoctor-emoji

```
The above command will install our Antora depends.

```
with:
  author_name: mitm001
  author_email: mitm001@users.noreply.github.com
  message: "Commit files for CI workflow"
```

The above is the author and message of the commit action. If the author name and email are not set, a warning will be thrown if `repository_dispatch` triggers a workflow. Customize as needed.

```
# Commits these files to root if and only if there are changes.
add: "package-lock.json package.json*"
```
This line will commit the `package-lock.json` and `package.json` if there are any changes to the files.

```
env:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
The `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` doesn't have authorization to create any successive events, so we avoid an infinite loop of commit, run workflows, commit, run workflows.

--
.. Add, commit and push the `antora-setup` branch to the repo. The workflow will commit the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files into the root of the `antora-setup` branch of the repo.
. Issue a pull request. This will pull in the `.json` files.
. Edit the `main.yml` file by commenting out the "`Install default package.json`", "`Install Node`" and "`Install Antora`" commands.
+
```
#    - name: Install default package.json
#      run: npm init --yes

#    - name: Install Node
#      run: npm i

#    - name: Install Antora
#      run: |
#       npm i @antora/cli@2.3
#       npm i @antora/site-generator-default@2.3
#       npm i asciidoctor-emoji
```
.. Add, commit and push the `antora-setup` branch to the repo.
. In the Atom Editor:
.. Edit the `package.json` file.
+
--
.package.json
[source, .json]
----
{
  "version": "1.0.1",
  "description": "jMonkeyEngine Documentation",
  "scripts": {
    "buildDocs": "$(npm bin)/antora --stacktrace wiki-playbook.yml"
  },
  "private": true,
  "license": "BSD-3-Clause",

}
----

NOTE: See: link:https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-package-json-guide[The Package Json Guide], and link:https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-package-lock-json-file[The package-lock.json file]  for info on the properties that can be set and their meaning.

--

- [x] Bump `"version": "1.0.1"`.
- [x] Fix the description.
- [x] Remove `test` from the scripts property.
- [x] Add the `buildDocs` script.
- [x] Add the `"private": true,` property.
- [x] Change the license.

.. Edit the `package-lock.json` file:

- [x] Bump  `"version": "1.0.1"`.

.. Stage, commit and push the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files to the repo.

== Preparing Test Site

We only need this step for a repository imported from the wiki, skip otherwise.

. From the (GWI).
.. Switch to the `gh-pages` branch and delete the `CNAME` file.
.. Commit the changes.
.. In the `Settings` tab, set the newly created branch as the "`Source`" under the GitHub Pages settings. The link box for the site will change color to green, indicating it is configured.
+
This will be the branch we deploy the site to using the "`Deploy Docs`" command in the `main.yml` file.

== Setup Antora

Add the configuration files. Once complete, our final source structure will look like so.

```
|-docs
| |-modules
| | |-ROOT
| |   |-nav.adoc
| |   |-images
| |   |-pages
| |   |-resources
| |-antora.yml
|-wiki-playbook.yml
```
. From the Atom Editor:
.. Add the initial `wiki-playbook.yml` file to the root of the repo.
+
--

NOTE: See: link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/playbook/set-up-playbook/[Set Up a Playbook] for detailed `key: value` explanations.

IMPORTANT: The branches key is set to `antora-setup`. The link:{attachmentsdir}/wiki-playbook.yml[wiki-playbook.yml] in the `transition-docs `module is set to use the `master` branch for versioning.

--
.. Add the link:{attachmentsdir}/antora.yml[antora.yml] file to the `docs` folder. It must be located next to the `modules` folder.

.. Stage, commit and push everything to the repo.
. From the (CLI):
.. Edit the main.yml file, uncommenting the `Run with CI`, `Build Docs`, `Copy Tutorials` `Deploy Docs` commands. If this is for the official wiki site, uncomment the `cname` key as well.
+
```
    - name: Run with CI
      run: npm ci

    - name: Build Docs
      run: npm run buildDocs

    # Antora will not copy folders outside the family tree so we move the
    # resources into the build/site folder so the peaceiris action will commit
    # the files.
    - name: Copy Tutorials
      run: cp -r ./docs/modules/ROOT/resources/* ./build/site/

    - name: Deploy Docs
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        # Commits these files to gh-pages if and only if there are changes.
        publish_dir: ./build/site
        # Insert CNAME for repository.
        cname: wiki.jmonkeyengine.org
```
.. Add, commit and push the `antora-setup` branch to the repo.

The build will succeed but if we examine the log file we find that the emoji.adoc page is broken. This is due to format changes using the new emoji macro.

. Issue a pull request from the Atom Editor.
. To save time, replace the `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/wiki/emoji.adoc` file with the `emoji.adoc` file found inside `transition-docs` module.

We are now down to one last set of warnings that need attention. When we examine the build log we see:

[source, text]
----
WARNING: skipping reference to missing attribute: home
WARNING: skipping reference to missing attribute: appname
WARNING: skipping reference to missing attribute: home
WARNING: skipping reference to missing attribute: appname
WARNING: skipping reference to missing attribute: 0
WARNING: skipping reference to missing attribute: 1
WARNING: skipping reference to missing attribute: 2
----

The `home` and `appname` missing attributes are due to unescaped content in the `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/sdk/update_center.adoc` file. This folder will be removed in the future but to stop the errors for now, fix the offending content.

. Escape one of the brackets in each string `$pass:[{]HOME}` and `$pass:[{]APPNAME}`.
+
```
"`$pass:[{]HOME}/.$pass:[{]APPNAME}/version`"
"`$pass:[{]HOME}/.$pass:[{]APPNAME}/nightly`"
```
. The second set of warning comes from the `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/jme3/advanced/logging.adoc` file. To fix this, look for and escape the string `++{0},{1},{2}++`.
+
```
`++{0},{1},{2}++`
```
. Stage, commit and push everything to the repo after editing.

== Cleanup

Delete the following from the `antora-setup` branch:

- [x] .editorconfig
- [x] .gitignore
- [x] .travis.yml
- [x] build.gradle
- [x] deploy_ghpages.sh
- [x] gradlew
- [x] gradle.bat
- [x] src directory (slim templates)
- [x] lib directory
- [x] gradle/wrapper

. Add the new README.adoc file from the `transition-docs` module to the root of the repository.
. Stage, commit and push everything to the repo after editing.

== Merge to Master

Once testing reveals everything is correctly setup, change the following settings to prepare for the final step of merging the antora-setup branch into master.

. Change the following settings:
.. Set the `branches:` value `antora-setup` to `master`
+
--
.main.yml
```
on:
  push:
    branches: '*'
```
and remove the `ref: antora-setup` from the  `Clone the repo` command.

```
steps:
- name: Clone the repo
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
  with:
    # Number of commits to fetch. 0 indicates all history.
    fetch-depth: 1
```
--
.. Set the `branches: [antora-setup]` value in the `wiki-playbook.yml` to point to HEAD.
+
```
content:
  sources:
  - url: .
    branches: HEAD
```
. Add, commit and push the `antora-setup` branch to the repository.
. Checkout the master branch, merge the `antora-setup` branch to `master` and push to the repository.
+
```
git checkout master
git merge antora-setup
git push origin master
```
. Delete the `antora-setup` setup branch.
+
```
git push -d origin antora-setup
```

== Post Rename Cache Commit

After the branch rename, change the workflow file `EndBug/add-and-commit@v4` "`add`" command to commit the cache upon changes.

```
# Commits these files to root if and only if there are changes.
add: "package-lock.json package.json ./.cache/antora/*"
```

After add, commit and pushing the workflow file, the cache will be committed to the repository master branch.
